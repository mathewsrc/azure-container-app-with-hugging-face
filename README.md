Project: Create an Azure Container App with Databricks


What is Azure Container App

Serverless infrastructure for deployments. We can easily deploy with scaling a HuggingFace machine-learning model 

1. Create a container app
   In order to create the container we need to follow the steps below:
   1. Create a new resource group
   2. Give the container app a global unique name
   3. Choose a Region (for me Brazil is the closest region)
